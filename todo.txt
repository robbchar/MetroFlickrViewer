things to possibly do
- SemanticZoom (maybe have a page that just has dates and then you could 'zoom' into the group)
- allow the user to see an even larger image in the detail view
- group bg image 
	have method to the handler to get all the images in a group and pick a random one
	- bug, since it does this as they are loading it can only select from the ones it has loaded, maybe do this when they are all loaded?
